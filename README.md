# Preside IP Geolocation APIs Extension
Preside extension to allow application developers to get all geolocation information about an IP address in a number of different formats.

Mainly developed for use with the https://extreme-ip-lookup.com/ IP Geolocation service but can be adapted to another provider.

Simply configure the API settings and that should be all you need.  Examples are given in the CMS Admin Settings form.

See the included handler `ipGeolocation.cfc` for examples of calling directly via ColdFusion server code or via AJAX
